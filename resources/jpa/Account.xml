  Persistence mapping for Account class (Beehive Account Manager 2.0)

  To keep the different layers clearly separated (plain domain object layer used for data
  transfer from persistence implementation), utilizing XML based configuration for the domain
  object. Additional persistence configuration is included as annotations in the persistence
  implementation. JPA will combine this XML and annotations as required.
